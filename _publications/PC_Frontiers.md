excerpt: 'This paper presents a deep learning-based automated method for accurately measuring penile curvature (PC) using 2D images. By leveraging YOLOv5 for localization, UNet for segmentation, and HRNet for landmark detection, the study achieves a mean absolute error of less than 5Â° on 3D-printed model images and demonstrates high accuracy when applied to real patient images, offering a promising tool for clinical assessment and hypospadiology research.'
