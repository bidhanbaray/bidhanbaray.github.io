excerpt: 'This paper focuses on human activity recognition in healthcare by analyzing sensor-based accelerometer data to predict 12 nurse care activities in both lab and real-life settings. The study addresses data imbalance and activity variability, employing noise filtering, windowing techniques, and feature extraction, ultimately achieving 65% accuracy and a 40% F1 score using a Random Forest classifier.'
