Human activity recognition has important applications in healthcare, human-computer interactions and other arenas. The direct interaction between the nurse and patient can play a pivotal role in healthcare. Recognizing various activities of nurses can improve healthcare in many ways. However, it is a very daunting task due to the complexities of the activities. "The 2nd Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge Using Lab and Field Data'' provides sensor-based accelerometer data to predict 12 activities conducted by the nurses in both the lab and real-life settings. The main difficulty of this dataset is to process the raw data because of a high imbalance among different classes. Besides, all activities have not been performed by all subjects. Our team, 'Team Apophis' has processed the data by filtering noise, applying windowing technique on time and frequency domain to extract various features from lab and field data distinctly. After merging lab and field data, the 10-fold cross-validation technique has been applied to find out the model of best performance. We have obtained a promising accuracy of 65% with an F1 score of 40% on this challenging dataset by using the Random Forest classifier.
