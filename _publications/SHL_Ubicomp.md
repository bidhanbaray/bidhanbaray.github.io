title: "An Empirical Approach for Human Locomotion and Transportation Recognition from Radio Data"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460418.3479384"
excerpt: 'This paper presents a machine learning approach for recognizing eight modes of locomotion and transportation using radio data from GPS, WiFi, and GSM cell towers in a user-independent manner. The study explores feature extraction techniques and model optimization, demonstrating that an XGBoost Classifier with selected features achieves an accuracy of 79.11% and an F1 score of 79.39% on the validation dataset.'
