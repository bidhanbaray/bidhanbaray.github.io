title: "EOGâ€‘Based Reading Detection in the Wild Using
Spectrograms and Nested Classification Approach"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251913"
excerpt: 'This paper explores a novel approach to detecting reading activities from electrooculography (EOG) signals collected in real-world environments. By combining statistical features with deep learning models and employing a nested classification approach, the study significantly improves reading activity detection accuracy to 66.56%, outperforming the baseline performance of 32%.'
